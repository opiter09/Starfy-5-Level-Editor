# Starfy-5-Level-Editor
Housing work that will eventually lead to a level editor for The Legendary Starfy

lzss.exe and its source code was not made by me, but rather by Cue, so thanks to them.
For proof of that, go to https://www.gbadev.org/tools.php?showinfo=1439. Also, unlike
my work the exe is licensed under the GPL; see "CUE license.txt" for more information
on that.
