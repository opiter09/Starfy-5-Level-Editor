I made a little python file to split apart an objects file into its component objects (namely
objSplit.py). All addresses below are in terms of a single 128-byte section.

0x0E-0x0F is the room to which a door goes. Note that this is only the room number, since the
world and level are implied (this is why the switch worlds cheat code works).
