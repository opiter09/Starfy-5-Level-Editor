I made a little python file to split apart an objects file into its component objects (namely
objSplit.py). All addresses below are in terms of a single 40-byte section.

0x00-0x01 is the thing's X value, and 0x02-0x03 is the thing's Y value, in terms of pixels, I think.
Furthermore, I have conclusively shown that the orign, (0, 0), is in the top left, and then values
get bigger going right and down.

Furthermore, I did some comparisons with the room size values they give at the beginning of the statics
chunks. I believe that each unit of X or Y there refers to a 16 pixel x 16 pixel block. I have, however,
seen a coordinate not divisible by 16 (with an 8 on the end), so that is probably why they don't just do
block numbers.

0x04-0x05 definitely is the ID of the object. Obviously with so many working out a full table
will be hard, but here is what I have so far:
- 0x02: Door
- 0x0B: Save Point

0x0E-0x0F is the room to which a door goes. Note that this is only the room number, since the
world and level are implied (this is why the switch worlds cheat code works).
